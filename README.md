# Dungoneer-Training
Before getting started, please message me on Discord (Yume#7302) to gain contribution access for the sake of doing work here.
To anyone who has access, please make sure you've selected the correct branch to be working from. If you have any questions, feel free to message me or any of the staff/partner devs for assistance.

To those interested in this project, you'll want to have the following:
1. Notepad++ or an equivilant organized txt document program
2. The base server files: https://mega.nz/#!IR9ngIbQ!mkDqoYmV5eKSYKemTwnZx1wwwxbJhIBC7Nalc-6AF24 (or a fork made from the repository on this page, to keep from editing the same files everyone starts off from)
3. Optional: mabiunpack.exe tool (related to getting additional files, recommended if you're working with items and additional scripts)

Once you have the necessary files, please refer to the wiki present in this github to get an understanding of how dungeons in mabinogi work for the sake of this project.
