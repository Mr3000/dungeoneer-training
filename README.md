# 100 Club Dungeon
This branch is for use in constructing a 100 floor dungeon for the sake of testing multiple types of scripts and experimenting with as many different features as possible. This will mainly be used to showing progress and improvements over time.

Starting from Alby's beginner dungeon, the goal is to create a progressive challenge dungeon that spans all current Mabinogi dungeons and eventually surpasses them. Test the bounds and try as many new things as possible or use whats done for reference to create something new!

Its advised to construct floors in sequences of 5 or 10, making each floor more difficult than the last by adding new mobs or unique gimmicks that make things more interesting.

Please be sure to inform me whenever changes are ready to be committed so we can avoid merge conflicts. This entire project is also voluntary but recommended for anyone who hasn't worked heavily on dungeons before.

If at any point anyone wants to work on their own projects, then they are free to. As a rule, please do not copy anyone else's work from this branch for your own without their permission.
